        description "Hot Water Extract, often referred to as HWE, is an analytical measure derived on a laboratory scale of the quantity of
        dissolved solids derived from malt or other materials used in the brewhouse. Hot water extract analysis is used to measure the brewing
         value of different malts or adjuncts and can be used to compare cereal varieties and malting processes. See adjuncts. It is used by
         brewers to compare malts and maltsters and as a measure to ensure malt delivered to a brewery is within a defined specification.
         Measurement of hot water extract is obtained by measuring the specific gravity of wort derived from a fixed weight of malt (or other
         material) that is ground in a specified manner at a fixed temperature for a specific time period. This process broadly mimics the
         mashing process in a brewery. See mashing. The wort is filtered, the specific gravity measured, and the hot water extract of the
         sample calculated. - https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/gPlMh2qEjm/";
